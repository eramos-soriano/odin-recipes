    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      This homemade ravioli recipe includes a pesto-Alfredo sauce and marinara.
      I wanted to recreate the ravioli dish that you get at Maggiano's Italian
      restaurant and it turned out great! Don't be intimidated by the large list
      of ingredients, it is well worth it.

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        To prepare the ravioli dough: Mound flour on a work surface and form a
        well in the center. Add eggs, olive oil, and salt to the well and beat
        together with a fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a fork or your fingers, gradually mix egg mixture into flour,
        working from the center out and using your other hand to keep the flour
        mound steady until a thick paste forms. Using your hands, press in
        remaining flour until a shaggy dough forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. (Dough should
        have consistency of modeling clay and bounce back when poked). Wrap
        dough in plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for at least 30
        minutes or up to 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling: Stir ricotta
        cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, parmesan, egg, parsley,
        salt, and pepper until well combined. Set the filling aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide dough into 4 even portions; wrap each portion in plastic wrap.
        Working with one portion at a time, flatten dough to about 1/3½-inch
        thickness. Roll the dough through a pasta machine at the widest setting.
        Fold the dough in thirds (like a letter), then run it through the
        machine at the same setting, folded edge first. Repeat the folding and
        rolling once more. Continue rolling the pasta twice through each
        consecutively smaller setting until dough is thin enough for you to see
        the outline of your hand through it. (Alternatively, if you do not have
        a pasta machine, roll dough with a rolling pin on a lightly floured work
        surface until dough is thin enough to see the outline of your hand
        through it, about 1/32-inch thickness).

        through it, about 1/32-inch thickness).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place second half of the dough sheet over the top and use your fingers
        to press around each portion of filling to press out any air and make
        the seal as airtight as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a sharp knife or pizza wheel, cut between the mounds to form
        squares (about 2- to 2 ½-inches each). Transfer ravioli to a baking
        sheet lightly dusted with flour. Repeat rolling and shaping process with
        remaining 3 dough portions.
      </li>
      <li>
        To prepare the sauce: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium
        heat. Stir in garlic and pesto sauce and cook, stirring constantly,
        until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in heavy cream; increase the heat
        to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and
        simmer until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk in Parmesan
        cheese until melted. Remove from the heat and keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, warm marinara sauce in a small saucepan over medium-low,
        stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil over high heat.
        Working in batches, add ravioli and return to a boil. Cook uncovered,
        stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the
        filling is hot, 4 to 6 minutes. Drain well.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, divide ravioli between four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle
        marinara sauce on top, followed by cream sauce.
      </li>
